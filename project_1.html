                    <h1>Kirby Victory Dance Animation (Cinema 4D) Project</h1>

                    <p>This was part of my final project for Introduction to 3D Animation. I animated Kirby's victory dance in Cinema 4D using primative objects, along with using Adobe Photoshop and adding his victory theme song in After Effects.</p>
                    
                    <p>The project was to animate a very simple character alongside animated text of their name, basically introducing the character. Many of the requirements were to animating a basic character utilizing principles of animation (Keyframing, Timeline, Deformers, 12 Principles of Animation). 
                       Kirby is one of my favorite characters growing up as a child, which lead me to construct Kirby using Cinema 4D. Doing his design was easy as I mostly used primative shapes. 
                       Next, was to find a 2D image Kirby and import the image to Adobe Photoshop and using the magic pen tool to erase his body, except for his facial features.
                       Afterwards, I imported the image as a JPG, and dragged it into Cinema 4D. 
                    </p>

                    <p>Next, I used the lightbox as part of the background and added the boss "Whispy Woods" to recreate Kirby's Victory Dance after defeating the boss.
                       Next, was to animate the character and adding many keyframes of each of his limbs, including moving the camera. I would also add a mograph effector as a way to introduce the character's name.
                       Once his victory dance was complete, I duplicated two other Kirbys just as the camera is looking directly at the other Kirbys. Once it was completed, I rendered the animation and exported the file
                       to Adobe After Effects, and added an Mp4 audio of Kirby Victory theme which was from (Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land). Afterwards, I render the whole project and exported the animation on Youtube.
